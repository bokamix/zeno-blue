# Inspiration Process

How professional designers find inspiration. They don't copy - they analyze, draw conclusions, adapt.

---

## 1. Understand context before searching

**Before opening Dribbble, answer these questions:**

### About the product/application:
- What does it do? What problem does it solve?
- Who uses it? (age, profession, tech-savviness)
- In what context? (work, home, on the go)
- How often? (daily, once a month)

### About tone and emotions:
- What emotions should it evoke? (trust, excitement, calm, professionalism)
- Formal or casual?
- Innovative or familiar?

### About constraints:
- Lots of data to display or minimalist UI?
- Accessibility features needed?
- Must match existing branding?

**Example:**
> "Personal finance app for young professionals (25-35), used daily in the morning with coffee. Should give a sense of control, be clear and readable, show lots of data without overwhelming."

## 2. Where to find inspiration

### Design galleries

**Awwwards** (awwwards.com)
- Highest quality, but often "art over function"
- Good for: landing pages, marketing sites, portfolios
- Search by categories and nominations

**Dribbble** (dribbble.com)
- Huge volume, varying quality
- Good for: components, UI patterns, style exploration
- Use filters: "Web Design", specific colors, tags

**Mobbin** (mobbin.com)
- Screenshots of real mobile apps
- Good for: UX patterns, real-world solutions
- Categorized by app type

**Godly** (godly.website)
- Curated collection of best sites
- Good for: modern, bold designs

**Land-book** (land-book.com)
- Landing pages grouped by category
- Good for: specific industries

### Real products (most important!)

Instead of galleries - see how the best in the industry do it:

**Fintech/Banking:**
- Stripe (stripe.com) - clean, professional, data-rich
- Mercury (mercury.com) - modern, startup-friendly
- Linear (linear.app) - dark mode done right
- Ramp (ramp.com) - bold, colorful but pro

**SaaS/Productivity:**
- Notion (notion.so) - minimalist, content-first
- Figma (figma.com) - playful but professional
- Vercel (vercel.com) - futuristic, dev-focused
- Raycast (raycast.com) - dark, sleek, keyboard-first

**E-commerce/Retail:**
- Apple (apple.com) - mastery of simplicity and space
- Aesop (aesop.com) - luxurious minimalism
- Mejuri (mejuri.com) - modern elegance

**Health/Wellness:**
- Headspace (headspace.com) - warm, friendly, illustrations
- Calm (calm.com) - peaceful, nature-inspired
- Oura (ouraring.com) - premium tech meets wellness

**Creative/Portfolio:**
- Pentagram (pentagram.com) - bold, editorial
- Huge (hugeinc.com) - experimental
- Basic Agency (basicagency.com) - clean, confident

## 3. How to analyze inspiration

**Don't copy - deconstruct.**

### Questions to ask:

**Typography:**
- What fonts do they use? How many families?
- How big is the scale between heading and body?
- What line-height and letter-spacing do they have?

**Color:**
- How many colors are in the palette?
- What's the ratio of primary/accent to neutrals?
- How do they create contrast and hierarchy?

**Layout:**
- How much white space is there?
- What's the rhythm/spacing between sections?
- How do they guide the eye through the page?

**Components:**
- What do buttons look like? Radii, shadows, hover states?
- How do they treat cards and containers?
- What interactions and animations do they have?

**Mood:**
- What makes it look [professional/warm/modern]?
- What one element is the "signature" of this design?

### Record conclusions, not screenshots

Not: "I like this site"

Yes: "Mercury uses:
- One font (Inter) in many weights
- Very little color - almost monochromatic with one accent
- Large, bold headings with very tight line-height
- Lots of negative space
- Subtle animations on scroll
- Cards with minimal shadow, rely more on spacing"

## 4. From inspiration to your own design

### Step 1: Collect 3-5 references

Not one (you'll copy it) and not twenty (you'll get lost).

Find:
- 2-3 from the same industry (how they solve similar problems)
- 1-2 from different industries (fresh perspective, non-obvious solutions)

### Step 2: Extract common patterns

What do the best examples in the industry have in common?

**Example for fintech:**
- Lots of white space (trust, clarity)
- Limited color palette (serious, stable)
- Readable typography (data must be clear)
- Subtle animations (professional, not toylike)

### Step 3: Find your twist

What will differentiate THIS design from others in the industry?

**Differentiation techniques:**
- Unusual font (but fitting the tone)
- Non-obvious accent color
- Unique "signature" - one element that's memorable
- Different layout than standard for the industry

### Step 4: Validate decisions

For every design decision:
- "Why this font?" → answer related to tone/context
- "Why this color?" → answer related to emotions/industry
- "Why this layout?" → answer related to content/UX

If the answer is "because that's how it was in the inspiration" - think again.
